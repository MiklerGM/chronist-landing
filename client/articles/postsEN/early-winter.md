During the last month we moved from simplified GeoJSON to MBtiles with Mapbox on the background. It made all the maps faster and much more detailed. Team is also in the middle of negotiations and joint development with the project «ChronoScio», as we wish to build a single well-made application together. Wish us luck.

We are always hanging out on Discord: https://discord.gg/fUuNaDk
