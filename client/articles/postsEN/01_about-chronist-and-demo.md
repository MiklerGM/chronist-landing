Have you ever thought that the beginning of Colonies in America, Ivan the Terrible rule in Russia, witch hunt in Europe and  completion of the Great Wall of China was all happening on our planet at the same time?

Our team started as group of friends interested in history and geography of different regions who lacked integral vision of world history. We were discussing the idea of Chronist for nearly five years before officially starting the company. Every time we talked about it with anybody interested we received so many ideas and questions it soon became clear that when we complete the project, find answers to all questions and draw all the templates we’ll all be very old and internet will already change enormously. So we started building the product from scratch based on our ideas and feedback from experiments. It’s still in MVP ('minimum viable product' according to Lean Startup methodology) stage and the design and functionality are not as remarkable as it can be, but continuous deployment process is doing its job - Chronist is becoming better every few months.
