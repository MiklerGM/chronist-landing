One of our major concerns is the reliability of data we are using. MVP is based on the data from wiki and US patent offices. Despite the controversy of Wikipedia articles we still decided to turn to it and focus on development challenges. However we mainly aim at the data that is linked to the official papers and scientific research. We are not by any chance affiliated with any political or nationalistic organizations and intend to represent adequate and scientific point of view.

Our team decided not to advertise while testing our hypothesis because the product is not at itâ€™s full capacity. Early adopters are always welcome, but we prefer not to spread the info in massive communities of people untimely.
