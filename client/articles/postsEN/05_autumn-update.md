We’ve spent six months migrating from D3.js to mobx and DeckGL and trying not to break down what we already had at the same time. Few functions were disabled (the much loved projection change is unfortunately among them, but we are doing our best to bring it back). Maps are now loading much faster even though we added a lot of new ones for more than 200 years. We have also rethought some parts of the UI, translated all project to english and got a second name https://chron.ist. If you find any mistakes or bugs please don’t hesitate to fill the error form or send us message via idea@chronist.ru
We are still looking for authors to collaborate with interactive historical courses.
