While choosing data for MPV (demo) we were looking for nice visual part, clear geo and historical data that can be found in the web. US history looked most promising from this point of view. Another reason was to attract high schoolers because the Colonial period is right in their history books. The great amount of events helped us verify our ideas about the speed of render time. All borders were drawn by hand and lots of data was translated to ensure that our team has the same vision of the final product as our users. We intend to develop Chronist as useful tool anyone will enjoy using.
