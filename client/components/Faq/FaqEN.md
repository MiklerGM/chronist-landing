1. Why did you choose this exact time period to be the first for visualisation?

  We started with the time period that had reliable and easy to find datasets. Also the visual part for the Colonial period is a good choice for demonstration because of the amount of borders changes and events.

2. Why is the project not completed yet?

  We are using Lean startup approach that helps us determine which of our ideas works best and collect feedback on updates pretty fast. That helps understand which part of the functionality should be developed on the first place. We are a team of 6 people and the first demo was developed from scratch in three months. We assume that completing code part for this project requires at least a year and half more, not to mention collecting historical data of different type.

3. What’s the main goal?

  Maps, chronology and layers are the essential part of Chronist. Each layer can be switched on/off or filtered to create own demo course. We also wish to add a tool to create own infographics. As for the dates we want to start from homo sapiens and finish somewhere around XXth century. We want to create a resource that helps gather different historical data on one interactive map.

4. How can it all be done at once?

  We create tools that display different types of data and at the same time gather and input the data to database. This helps us change the design up-to-date. We are also relying on the community and users who put forward ideas and routes we could never have imagined half a year before.

5. What’s with the reliability of your data?

  As most reliable data sources we see official papers and scientific research, collaboration with databases that has links to original sources. As for the courses the main source is its author.

6. Will there be any moderation?

    As for now we don’t expect any of our content to be subject to moderation, however due to the expansion of the data moderation policy can be changed.
